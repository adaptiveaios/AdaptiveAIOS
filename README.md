# **AdaptiveAIOS**

AdaptiveAIOS is a forward-thinking initiative aimed at redefining the way we interact with operating systems by leveraging advanced AI concepts. At its core, the project explores **Activation Path Vectors (APV)**, a novel mechanism for tracking neural network activations to enhance stability, interpretability, and adaptive learning.

---

## **What is APV?**

The **Activation Path Vector (APV)** methodology provides a high-level summary of a neural network's internal activation pathways. APVs are designed to:

- **Enhance Interpretability**: Offer a concise representation of activation patterns within neural networks, enabling better understanding and diagnostics.
- **Monitor Stability**: Ensure consistency in model responses over time by comparing new APVs against established baselines.
- **Enable Adaptive Training**: Guide reinforcement learning by identifying successful activation pathways and allowing controlled deviations for improvement.

This concept has the potential to revolutionize how AI models are monitored and optimized, particularly in environments requiring high reliability and adaptability.

## **Repository Structure**

- **`main`**: Contains the core vision, documentation, and links to relevant branches.
- **`APV_Prototype`**: A branch showcasing an implementation of APVs for monitoring activation pathways in neural networks.
- **`Apv_module_project`**: Houses the modular APV implementation, complete with examples and APIs.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Baseline APV Collection**: Generate and store activation pathways for random or predefined inputs to establish a baseline.
2. **APV Consistency Loss**: Custom loss functions enforce model stability by penalizing deviations from baseline APVs during training.
3. **Dynamic APV Adjustment**: Adapt APV targets in real time to accommodate new input scenarios while maintaining stability.

## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**
To access all branches:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adaptiveaios/AdaptiveAIOS.git
cd AdaptiveAIOS
```

Switch to the **APV_Prototype** branch for the activation path vector implementation:
```bash
git checkout APV_Prototype
```
