# **APV_Prototype**

The **APV_Prototype** module demonstrates the implementation of **Activation Path Vectors (APV)** to enhance the interpretability and stability of AI models. This prototype includes mechanisms for collecting APVs, enforcing consistency, and dynamically adjusting APV targets for evolving inputs.

---

## **Overview**
- **APVs**: Provide a traceable pathway for activations within an AI model, enabling transparency and consistency in responses.
- **Training**: Uses APV Consistency Loss to improve output stability.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Supports real-time updates to APV targets based on new inputs.

This module is part of the broader **AdaptiveAIOS** project, aimed at developing dynamic and adaptable AI-driven operating systems.

---

## **Features**
1. **Baseline APV Collection**: Generates and stores APVs from random prompts as a reference for consistent response generation.
2. **APV Consistency Loss**: Custom loss function to enforce activation consistency during training.
3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Real-time adaptation of APVs to accommodate new prompts and evolving input data.

## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**
To get all branches of the repository, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adaptiveaios/AdaptiveAIOS.git
cd AdaptiveAIOS
git checkout APV-Prototype
```

---

### **Dependencies**
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch**: Install via:
  ```bash
  pip install torch
  ```
- **Transformers**: Install via:
  ```bash
  pip install transformers
  ```

---

## **Usage**

1. **Navigate to the Module Directory**
   ```bash
   cd APV_Prototype
   ```

2. **Run the Script**
   Execute the prototype script:
   ```bash
   python3 apv_prototype.py
   ```

---

### **Code Highlights**

#### **Baseline APV Collection**
The script generates random prompts and calculates their APVs using a language model. These APVs are stored as a baseline for consistency checks.

#### **APV Consistency Loss**
A custom loss function (`APVConsistencyLoss`) ensures output stability by penalizing deviations from baseline APVs during training.

#### **Dynamic APV Adjustment**
Supports the real-time adjustment of APV targets for new inputs, enhancing adaptability and reducing unpredictability.

### **Example Output**
The training process outputs the progress for each epoch, including the prompt and associated loss:
```text
Epoch 0, Prompt: Random prompt 0 with variation 0.2, Loss: 1.4017
Epoch 0, Prompt: Random prompt 1 with variation 0.3, Loss: 1.3403
...
Epoch 1, Prompt: Random prompt 0 with variation 0.2, Loss: 0.0098
```

## **Future Enhancements**
- Extend APV compatibility with larger datasets and diverse input types.
- Optimize APV calculations for speed and scalability.
- Explore additional applications of APVs in reducing model hallucinations across domains.
