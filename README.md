APV Prototype

This module demonstrates the concept of Activation Path Vectors (APV) for improving AI model interpretability and stability. APVs trace and map activation pathways within AI models, enabling insights into how specific inputs trigger particular responses and ensuring consistency across outputs.
Key Features

    Baseline APV Collection: Generate and store APVs for random prompts to serve as a reference.
    APV Consistency Loss: Apply a custom loss function during training to enforce stability in model responses.
    Dynamic APV Adjustment: Adapt APV targets in real-time for evolving inputs.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    PyTorch
    Transformers

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages:

pip install torch transformers

Usage
1. Clone the Repository

Clone the AdaptiveAIOS repository and navigate to the APV_Prototype directory:

git clone https://github.com/adaptiveaios/AdaptiveAIOS.git
cd AdaptiveAIOS/APV_Prototype

2. Run the Code

Use the script to test the APV implementation:

python3 apv_prototype.py

Code Overview
1. Baseline APV Collection

The script generates random prompts and calculates their APVs to serve as a baseline reference.
2. APV Consistency Loss

A custom loss function (APVConsistencyLoss) enforces stability by penalizing deviations from baseline APVs during training.
3. Dynamic APV Adjustment

The script supports real-time adjustment of APV targets based on new inputs, enabling adaptability in the model.
Example Output

The script will output progress during training, showing the prompt and the associated loss for each epoch:

Epoch 0, Prompt: Random prompt 0 with variation 0.2009, Loss: 1.4017
Epoch 0, Prompt: Random prompt 1 with variation 0.3106, Loss: 1.3403
...
Epoch 1, Prompt: Random prompt 0 with variation 0.2009, Loss: 0.0098

Future Enhancements

    Extend APV training to handle larger datasets and diverse input types.
    Optimize APV calculation for speed and scalability.
    Explore applications of APVs in reducing model hallucinations in various domains.
